This is main branch where all finished projects will be stored. 
For project to be considered FINISHED it must have: 1. Requirements written in any format
                                                    2. Electrical schematic / software design (both if neccesary and in free form)
                                                    3. Unit tests for all modules
                                                    4. Source code with all the comments and references
                                                    5. System demonstration in form of a video

All new projects MUST have new branch created and on that branch new folder with UNIQUE project name. That way main will have all projects sorted in folders.
Project is merged into main ONLY when 5 conditions are met and reviewed.

TIPS:
- use create_project to generate all neccessary files (updates in future for UTS, SWDD, and schematic).
- for flashing use COM port and for debugging use USB port on ESP32
- WiFi anenna (metal plate) needs to be pressed for WiFi to connect (work on fix)
